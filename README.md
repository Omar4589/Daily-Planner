## Instructions

_Each time-block (9AM,10Am,11AM, etc.) has a text box next to it._

- Write the activity you want to focus on inside the corresponding time-block text box.

- Click the save button next to the text box to save your input. (Input saved to local storage)
  - If you'd like to edit your input:
    - Click inside the text box
    - Edit the text
    - Press the save button again to save the new input

_Each time-block is color coded based on the current hour of the day._<br>

- _Grey background is used for time-blocks past the current hour_<br>
- _Red background is used for the time-block matching the current hour_<br>
- _Green background is used for time-blocks within a future hour_<br>

_In example, if it is currently 10am, the 9am time-block will have a grey background._<br>
_The 10am time-block will be red, indicating it is currently 10am & you should work on the planned activities for that time-block._<br>
_Time-blocks after 10am will appear green to indicate the planned activities are to be worked on in the future._<br>
