_Each time-block is color coded_<br>

- _Grey background is used for time-blocks in the past_<br>
- _Red background is used for time-blocks in the present_<br>

_In example, if it is currently 12pm, the 9am, 10am, and 11am time-blocks will have a grey background._<br>
_The 12pm time-block will be red, indicating it is currently 12pm & you should work on the planned activities for that time-block._<br>
_Time-block's after 12pm will appear green to indicate the planned activities are to be worked on in the future._<br>
